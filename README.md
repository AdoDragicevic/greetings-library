# greetings-library

I was inspired by reading the sorce code of jQuery to write a small library that uses method chaining, 
closures to create private (non-accessible) variables and other features found in the source code of jQuery.

- method chaining
- hidden values (closure)
- constructing objects without keyword "new"
- 4 languages
- formal and informal greetings
