# greetings-library

### While trying to understand the sorce code of jQuery I was inspired to write a small library that uses method chaining, closures to create private (non-accessible) variables and other features found in its source code.

## Features
* method chaining
* hidden values (closure)
* constructing objects without keyword "new"
* 4 languages
* formal and informal greetings

## Using
* Vanilla JS (ES6)
